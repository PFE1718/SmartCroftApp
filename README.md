## Mycroft automation manager

## Target

As an external tool for our [Mycroft Habits Miner](https://github.com/PFE1718/PFE1718-habit-miner) we wanted to add a small management interface. This small piece of software takes its place.

## Getting started

From the root of the project run `yarn build` and then `yarn start`. You should see the application icon on top or on the bottom of your Operating System depending on which one you are running.

## Usage

### Skills manager

The first part of the application refers to the list of the habits that have already been automatized for you. You can disable them by pressing the `Disable` button on the bottom of each item. When you're done, you can press the `Save` button on top of the application to apply your changes.
